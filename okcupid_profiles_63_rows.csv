kids,likes dogs,has cats,other,aquarius and it matters a lot,no,english (fluently),"i tend to be very focused some of the time when first meeting. i am very passionate about a great deal of things and will talk about them for days. trying to take time to make community of creative types but center on building connections. this is my second account on this site as i saw significant changes in my outlook on life. i relish in the fact that i can take opportunities to rediscover myself.  the main reason i have come to like this site is the possibilities or potential to connect with someone. unless you live in the bay area or are planning to i have little time to develop or devote to someone i have no chance of seeing face to face unless they give some compelling reason. that would include but not limit things that pertain to what is on my profile here. i will quiz you on what is contained here.  i believe in connection. it is more important than anything and have a passion about it. i am extremely serious about this. if you want to ask me about this be prepared for a long response.  i have boundaries and abide by them.  the next thing that is very important is that i ignore people who do not have a match percentage at all and try to use this site for ads to their other web pages. take some time to fill out a few of the questions and profile. thanks.  i am intense, positive, and artistic",i seem to have difficulty finding work that will not just give empty promises.  i am learning about reconnecting with myself and those who are of similar mind. of late i have considered what it means to be me in a greater sense. this is another reason i am on this and other sites. if you get a message or comment from me it is likely that i have found a connection point with you.  always looking for those who can understand what dreaming really is.  testing the limits of sane and safe behavior in the insane world we all have created.  watching my daughter drive everyone crazy.  finding the humor in just about everything about me.  enjoying the new connections in my life and living them to the fullest.  telling the people who are important to me that they are loved.  teaching my daughter how to recognize the limits that humans have to deal with on a regular basis.  coping with the moments as they come to me.  finishing the questions on this site and hoping that some good friends come out of it. i will also send a message to those that message me. being one with the universe. thinking on changes that are happening to my life. trying to see things as they really are not what they seem to be. listening for the little things that add up to the bigger ones. listening to the soul of things as i see it. trying to make connections with others.,...being in the right place. foot rubs. i also seem to have the ability hold people's attention without even trying sometimes. noticing people who notice things around them.getting the trust of complete strangers. touching the soul of others. pushing the limits of creativity.,my eyes or my hair.  i have very intense eyes that people say look right through things. the other thing is that sometimes i seem really tall. the intensity is what usually gets most people. my intensity is shown in just about all of me. i welcome your messages to tell me what you see.  i occasionally color my hair to help thin it and keep the white at bay for the moment. my hair is longer now and still very thick. i have a love of hair that borders on a fetish. the longer the better. apparently the color of my hair is a very interesting topic for the moment.,"books: i have a deep love of just about anything by isaac asimov. robert heinlein is also up there. i have been reading science fictionsince 7 years old. ray bradbury is really good too. neil gaiman is probably my favorite now. i think i am starting to like terry brooks as well. i have a lot of books about the stuff that i am interested in and am trying to find a way to compose my own. philip pullman is on the list too. i just realized that c. s. lewis is also big on my reading list. i have a large collection of supernatural beings in my collection. yes even some old d&d novels are in there. everyone has their fluff to read. friday by robert a. heinlein, aisling by louise cooper, lion's blood by steven barnes, harry potter, dracula by bram stoker(unabridged), beowulf, and more to name later. the black dagger brotherhood books by j. r. ward are interesting.  movies: beowulf adapted by gaiman. the lord of the rings:rotk the extended version filled my nights with pondering.  music: i have always liked what is now called ""classic rock"" though when it comes to playing or composing i tend to be more blues oriented. i have a thing for percussion of all types. largely depends on what my mood is at the time. i have over a thousand cd's in my collection. i have just about every kind of music. what is there not to like save for the stuff that puts people down. as long as it takes you someplace it is very welcome. of late though i am starting to drift back into a darker mood to the music i listen to for the moment. my youtube account has a good representation. music means a lot to me. angus young, henry rollins, danny elfman, jimi hendrix, colin hays, joan jett, robert johnson, tenacious d, concrete blonde, howard jones, metallica, kmfdm, lycia, estampie, rob zombie comprise the beginning of the list of music in my head. at least for today. i really like all kinds of music. i don't think music has ever left my life and for that i am very thankful. it has the capacity to change the coldest heart and calm the troubled mind. i felt it early on in my soul. i belive music is a language to itself. i would defend music and its right to be played at any cost.  shows: i am into british science fiction shows. firefly. dr. who. red dwarf. hex. supernatural. smallville. painkiller jane. have not watched much else but am enjoying a lot of series on netflix very much. i had a weak spot for forever knight and special unit 2 when they first aired.  food: the one thing that i cannot even stomach is the combination of broccoli and cheese together. just about anything else will work. my weakness is all things made from blueberries. i just cannot pass up anything with them in it. the biggest bummer is when they took the blueberry newtons off the market. i found a substitute but they are not the same. and to think that blueberries are good for you.",connections. love. music. serene moments. laughter. the universe.,"experience has shown me that there is no limit to the repercussion that can happen based on a single action. it takes but a moment to connect in a meaningful way.  it is as if by someone actually reading all of this rambling that they could glean something of my personality and find it within them to craft some witty response to what my mind was going through at this time. when all is said and done this sojourn that is life will be what it wanted to be. i am a man of many things.  it also seems very odd to me to consider writing a response to something that obviously by its phrasing at this writing wants a single response and not necessarily a discourse. yet for some reason rather than attempt to write a test for this site i continue to fill in characters to bring this character total to an acceptable place.  tell me what you make of this.i have seen where these interests have taken me. i want to see if a new leaf is in order. they began with acting,

addressing the issue of privacy i think it is best discussed face to face. there is too much chance for ambiguity in this two dimensional place.  i wear my heart on my sleeve. if you ask me i will find an answer.  in the end of things i think living one's life is best surmised by the connections that each person makes.,you feel like it.  you have actually read the entire profile and can answer at least one question about me that i pose to you. i happen to be on the same time you are.  the next thing that is very important is that i delete people who do not have a match percentage at all and try to use this site for ads to their other web pages. take some time to fill out a few of the questions and profile. thanks.  i am not opposed to im on here but mostly am on this site at work so content is an issue. i like to keep my income in the black. i check my stalker list freqently so if you see me on yours it means that somehow you either had fate intervene on your behalf by being on mine or the quickmatch gave us a good rating.  this seems to be the default place where most users on this take the opportunity to air out the frustration of the kinds of people they do not want to message them. i don't mind a message if you realize that if you live outside the area of california that there is not a very likely chance that i will respond. i am not saying no but you had better have some very compelling reason to take the time to actually write something.
